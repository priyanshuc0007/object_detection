Object Detection with OpenCV and DETR Model Documentation
This Python script utilizes the OpenCV library and the DETR (DEtection TRansformer) model for object detection in real-time using a webcam.

Libraries Used:
cv2: OpenCV library for computer vision tasks.
transformers: Library for natural language processing and computer vision tasks, used here for object detection.
torch: PyTorch deep learning framework.
PIL: Python Imaging Library for image processing tasks.



Initialization:
The script initializes the DETR model and image processor from the Hugging Face Transformers library. The DETR model is a state-of-the-art object detection model based on transformers.
It also initializes the webcam capture using OpenCV.
Main Loop:
Capture Frame: Continuously captures frames from the webcam using OpenCV's VideoCapture object.
Convert Frame: Converts the frame from BGR to RGB format using OpenCV.
Process Frame: Converts the RGB frame to a PIL Image and processes it with the image processor to prepare it for object detection.
Object Detection: Uses the DETR model to perform object detection on the processed frame.
Post-Processing: Post-processes the detection results to extract bounding boxes, labels, and confidence scores for detected objects.
Drawing Bounding Boxes: Draws bounding boxes around detected objects on the frame using OpenCV's drawing functions.
Display Frame: Displays the resulting frame with bounding boxes and labels using OpenCV's imshow function.
Exit Condition: Checks for the 'q' key press to exit the loop and stop the webcam capture.


Cleanup:
Releases the webcam using cap.release() and closes all OpenCV windows using cv2.destroyAllWindows().
Note:
The script continuously detects objects in real-time using the webcam feed until the user presses the 'q' key to exit.
Detected objects are displayed with bounding boxes and labels, along with their confidence scores.
The script utilizes the DETR model for object detection, which provides accurate and efficient detection results.
Usage:
Ensure that the necessary libraries (cv2, transformers, torch, PIL) are installed.
Run the script, and it will open a window displaying the webcam feed with object detection results.
