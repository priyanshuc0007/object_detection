Imports necessary modules including DetrImageProcessor and DetrForObjectDetection from the transformers library, along with torch for PyTorch, PIL for image handling, and requests for fetching the image from a URL.
Defines the URL of the image to be processed.
Uses Image.open() from the PIL library to open the image from the provided URL.
Initializes the DETR image processor and object detection model using DetrImageProcessor.from_pretrained() and DetrForObjectDetection.from_pretrained() respectively. It specifies the model architecture by providing the appropriate model identifier ("facebook/detr-resnet-50") and also specifies the revision "no_timm" if you don't want the timm dependency.
Preprocesses the image using the initialized processor to obtain input tensors suitable for the model.
Passes the input tensors to the model to obtain the detection outputs.
Post-processes the model outputs using processor.post_process_object_detection() to obtain the final detected objects with their scores and bounding boxes.
Iterates through the detected objects and prints their labels, confidence scores, and bounding box coordinates.
This code demonstrates how to perform object detection using the DETR model provided by Hugging Face Transformers. You can adjust the threshold value to control the minimum confidence score required for an object to be considered a detection.
